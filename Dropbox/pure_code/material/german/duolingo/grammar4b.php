    <h3 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white" id='0'>1 Prepositions</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Prepositions take a noun (or a noun phrase):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I talk <em>with a friend from school</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In German, prepositions will change this noun into one of the cases (but never into nominative).</p>
        <p>Here, you learn those that always trigger the accusative case.</p>
        <p>
            Remember that as long as the noun is not masculine singular, the nominative and the accusative will look the
            same.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Der</em> Hund trinkt <em>den</em> Saft. (both are masculine)</li>
            <li><em>Die</em> Katze trinkt <em>die</em> Milch. (both are feminine)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white" > 1 Accusative prepositions</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Accusative prepositions <em>always</em> trigger the accusative case.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nicht <strong>ohne meinen Hund</strong>! (Not without my dog!)</li>
            <li>Die Suppe ist <strong>für den Mann ohne Zähne</strong>. (The soup is for the man without teeth.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p id='1'>German has these common accusative prepositions: <strong>durch, für, gegen, ohne, um</strong></p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">2 <em>Entlang</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            <em>Entlang</em> is a strange word :) It is commonly used with the accusative case. But then it has to appear
            <strong>after the noun</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ich gehe <em>den Fluss entlang</em>. (I walk along the river.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It can be used before the noun, but then triggers a different case. This sounds a bit old-fashioned or
            stilted today. So better use it after the noun.

    <h3 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">3 German numbers</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            You might notice that German numbers look very similar to those in English. The two languages are closely
            related. So any time you encounter a new word, it's worth checking whether you can find a similar-looking
            word in English.
        </p>
        <p>
            At some point, you might realize that there are several more or less consistent changes between English and
            German. Here are some:
        </p>
        <table class="table">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Change</th>

        <p>
            Generally, the vowels change faster than the consonants. So go for the consonants when looking for related
            words.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">4<em>Zahlen, zahlen, zählen</em></h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            You learned <em>bezahlen</em> (to pay) earlier. There's also the word <em>zahlen</em>, which also means to
            pay. In this lesson, you learn <em>z<strong>ä</strong>hlen</em>, which means "to count". Don't confuse the
            two.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, you will see <em>Zahlen</em>. The upper-case initial tells you this is a noun. It is the plural
            of <em>die Zahl</em> (the number).
        </p>

    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">5<em>Küche</em> vs. <em>Kuchen</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            <em>Die Küche</em> (the kitchen) and <em>der Kuchen</em> (the cake) are often confused by learners. To German
            ears, they sound quite different. One reason is that in <em>Küche</em>, the vowel is short, while the vowel
            in <em>Kuchen</em> is long.
        </p>

            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><em>Kochen</em> (to cook) also has a short vowel.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">6<em>Schmecken</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p><em>Schmecken</em> is very similar to the English word "to taste":</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ich schmecke Knoblauch! (I taste garlic!)</li>
            <li>Knoblauch schmeckt super! (Garlic tastes great!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, <em>schmecken</em> can be used by itself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Die Pizza schmeckt nicht! (The pizza does not taste <em>good</em>!)</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">8<em>Müsli</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            <em>Müsli</em> originally refers to "Bircher Müesli", a Swiss breakfast dish, based on rolled oats and fresh
            or dried fruits.
        </p>
        <p>Nowadays, people will use it for all kinds of cereals or granola, often with high sugar content.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">9<em>Hähnchen</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            <em>Hähnchen</em> usually refers to a chicken that has been turned into a dish. While derived from the word
            for "male chicken" (<em>der Hahn</em>), the only distinction today is that it is a food item.
        </p>
        <p>Remember that words ending in <em>-chen</em> are always neuter: <em>das Hähnchen</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">10<em>Salat</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            <em>Salat</em> can refer to the dish, as well as to the green leaves (usually lettuce) that often go into it.

    <h3 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">11The Dative Case</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Welcome to the third important case in German :) Later on, there will be a last, less important one.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">12Remember the Accusative ?</h4>
    <div>
        <p>You already saw that the <strong>accusative case</strong> can be used in different ways.</p>
        <p>It can signify the <em>object of a sentence</em>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Der Hund frisst <em>den Vogel</em>. (The dog is eating the bird.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is called the <strong>direct object</strong> (or <strong>accusative object</strong>).</p>
        <p>It can also be used <em>in combination with some prepositions</em>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sie geht <em>ohne den Hund</em>. (She walks without the dog.)</li>
            <li>Er hat einen Mantel <em>ohne Knöpfe</em>. (He has a coat without buttons.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">13 Dative object</h4>
    <div>
        <p>The <strong>dative case</strong> also <strong>has a range of different functions</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            In this lesson, you learn to use it with the <strong>indirect object</strong>. This is also called the
            <strong>dative object</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>The indirect object in a sentence is the <strong>receiver of the direct (accusative) object</strong>.</p>
        <p>For example, <em>Frau</em> is the indirect (dative) object in</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Das Mädchen gibt <em>einer Frau</em> den Apfel. (A girl gives the apple <em>to a woman</em>.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can think about it as "the other person involved" in a transaction.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ich gebe <em>dem Mann</em> einen Apfel. (I give <em>the man</em> an apple.)</li>
            <li>Sie zeigt <em>dem Kind</em> den Hund. (She shows <em>the child</em> the dog.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Generally, the <strong>dative object comes before the accusative object</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">14 Dative verbs</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            The dative is also used for certain dative verbs such as <em>danken</em> (to thank) and <em>antworten</em>
            (to answer), or <em>helfen</em> (to help):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ich danke <em>dem Kind</em>. (I thank the child.)</li>
            <li>Ich helfe <em>der Frau</em>. (I help the woman.)</li>
            <li>Ich antworte <em>meinem Bruder</em>. (I answer my brother.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These verbs don't have an accusative object.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">15 Dative articles</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Note that the <strong>dative changes all articles for the words</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            For example, <em>die Katze</em> is a feminine noun. However, the article in dative will be <em>der</em>. This
            might look like the masculine article. But in the context of a sentence, there will never be any confusion
            between the two, as long as you know your genders. This is one reason why it's so important to know the
            gender of a word.

        </table>
        <p>
            Notice how <strong>masculine and neuter look the same in Dative</strong> (just like they look the same for
            Nominative indefinite articles).
        </p>
        <p>
            This also means that if you see a noun in the Dative, and the article ends in <em>-r</em>, it will be a
            feminine word. Alternatively, if it ends in <em>-m</em>, it won't.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is very much <strong>worth remembering these Dative endings</strong>, because they will pop up in
            different context, and help you a lot to sort out the grammar. In a way, Dative is the "simplest" case :)

    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white"> 16 Plural Nouns in Dative</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Here's a great rule:</p>
        <p><strong>Plural Dative: Everything gets an <em>-n</em></strong></p>
        <p>(Insert Oprah Winfrey GIF here)</p>
        <p>You just saw that articles (also pronouns etc.) get an <em>-n</em> ending in dative plural.</p>
        <p>
            Later, you will learn that the German ending system for adjectives is a bit complicated. However, in dative
            plural, you just <strong>add an <em>-n</em></strong>.
        </p>
        <p>It goes so far that even <strong>plural forms of nouns get an extra <em>-n</em> in the Dative</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Er hat <em>drei Hunde</em>. Er spielt <em>mit drei Hunden</em>. (He plays with three dogs.)</li>
            <li>Die Computer sind alt. Ich antworte <em>den Computern</em>. (I answer the computers.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are two "exceptions":</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the plural already end in <em>-n</em>, you're set.</li>
            <li>If the plural ends in <em>-s</em>, there's also no change.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">17 Even more <em>-n</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            <strong>Some masculine nouns add an <em>-en</em> or <em>-n</em> ending</strong> in the dative and in <strong>
            all
            other cases besides the nominative
        </strong>. For example in the dative, it is <em>dem Jungen</em> (the boy).
        </p>
        <p>If you want to look these up, the term for them is "n-Declension".</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row d-block">
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">18 <em>Euro</em> or <em>Euros</em>?</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            In German, the singular is <em>Euro</em> and the <strong>plural is usually <em>Euro</em></strong> as well. As
            a rule of thumb, use <em>Euro</em> when talking about a specific amount, e.g. <em>200 Euro</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some contexts, the form <em>Euros</em> is used as well. For instance, you can say <em>Euros</em> to refer
            to individual euro coins, an unquantified amount of euros, or euros as opposed to a different currency,
            e.g.:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ich habe hundert Schweizer Franken, aber keine <em>Euros</em> (I have a hundred Swiss francs but no
                euros).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many native speakers use either plural form regardless of context.</p>
        <p>
            In English, either plural form is perfectly fine. The plural form <em>euro</em> tends to be preferred in the
            Republic of Ireland, and the plural form <em>euros</em> tends to preferred pretty much anywhere else.
            Originally, the plural form <em>euro</em> was supposed to be used in official EU documents, but that's no
            longer the case.

    <div>
        <p>
            Many words change in the dative case. For the third person pronouns, the following are different from the
            nominative case: the masculine pronoun is <em>ihm</em> (to him), the feminine is <em>ihr</em> (to her), the
            neuter is <em>ihm</em> (to it), and the plural is <em>ihnen</em> (to them).

        <p>Some observations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In dative, <em>mir, dir, ihr</em> (to me / you / her) rhyme.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In the <strong>third person</strong>, the <strong>endings are the same as for the articles</strong>:
                    <em>-m, -r, -n</em>. However, plural dative is "ihn<strong>en</strong>" (not <em>ihn</em>, as you
                    might expect).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the second person plural, accusative and dative pronouns are the same.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Now you can understand why, when thanking a female person, it is only correct to say <em>Ich danke ihr</em>
            ("I thank her", literally "I give-thank to her") and not <em>Ich danke sie</em> (that sounds like "I thank
            she" would sound to an English speaker).

    <div>
        <p>
            Remember that some verbs have a dative object. This is just a quirk of German. There was a reason for it when
            these words were created, but it's not easy to understand anymore, after a lot of language change.
        </p>
        <p>In short, you just have to learn these :) There aren't very many.</p>
        <p>
            <em>Gehören</em> literally means to "belong to". But don't translate too literally, often a different
            translation will be more natural.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wem gehört das Kleid? ("Whose dress is it?" - Literally, "Whom does the dress belong to?")</li>

        <p>Tall people are <em>groß</em>, not <em>hoch</em>, and short people are <em>klein</em>, not <em>kurz</em>.</p>

    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">22 <em>Cousin, Cousine</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            These are French words. While it is possible to write <em>Cousine</em> as <em>Kusine</em> now, German never
            found a way to actually spell <em>Cousin</em> differently. This is because German originally does not have
            the French sound at the end. Some people pronounce it like "Kusäng" instead.

            Both <em>Die Frau kennt ihren Onkel</em> and <em>Die Frau kennt seinen Onkel</em> are grammatically correct,
            but they don't have the same meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you say <em>Die Frau kennt ihren Onkel</em>, you're either talking about the woman's own uncle, another
            female person's uncle, or the uncle of multiple people.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you say <em>Die Frau kennt seinen Onkel</em>, you're talking about another person's uncle, and that

    <h3 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">26 <em>Seit</em></h3>
    <div>
        <p><em>Seit</em> roughly means "since". However, it works a bit differently.</p>
        <p>First, it always denotes something that is <strong>still going on</strong>.</p>
        <p>Second, it has <strong>three different ways</strong> of usage.</p>
        <p>Consider these examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ich lerne <em>seit sechs Jahren</em> Englisch. (I'm learning English for six years now.)</li>
            <li>Ich lerne <em>seit 2012</em> Englisch (I've been learning English since 2012.)</li>
            <li>Ich lerne Englisch, <em>seit ich denken kann</em>. (I've been learning English since I can think.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the first example, <em>seit</em> defines a stretch of time, which reaches into the present.</p>
        <p>
            In the second example, it also defines a stretch of time, reaching into the present. But it defines this
            stretch of time by its starting point.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Seit</em> can also be a subordinating conjunction (check the lesson "Conjunctions"). In these, the verb
            leaves the second position of the sentence, and ends up at the end. This is why in the last example, <em>
            ich
            kann denken
        </em> (I can think) turns into <em>seit ich denken <strong>kann</strong></em>.

    <h3 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">27 <em>Zu Hause</em> vs. <em>nach Hause</em></h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            <em>Zu Hause</em> means <em>at home</em>, and <em>nach Hause</em> means <em>home</em> (<em>homewards</em>,
            not <em>at home</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>-e</em> at the end of <em>zu Hause</em> and <em>nach Hause</em> is an archaic dative ending, which is
            no longer used in modern German, but survived in certain fixed expressions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Ich bin zu Hause. (I am at home.)</p>

        </p>
        <ul>

            word combinations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Elfenbein (ivory, literally "elephant bone")</li>
            <li>Eisbein (pork knuckle, literally "ischias bone", because it referred to hip meat before)</li>
            <li>Beinhaus (bone house)</li>

<h3 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white"> 33German You: Who are you talking to?</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        In English, "you" can be either singular or plural, and no distinction is made between formal and informal.
        In German, there are <strong>three ways of saying "you"</strong>.
    </p>
</div>
<h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">34<em>Du</em></h4>
<div>
    <p>
        If you are <strong><em>familiar</em> with someone, you use <em>du</em></strong> (which is called "duzen"). For
        example, if you talk to your mother, you would say:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Hast <em>du</em> jetzt Zeit, Mama?" (Do you have time now, Mommy?).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use this form for family members, co-students, children and young adults.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">35<em>Ihr</em></h4>
<div>
    <p>
        If you <strong>refer to more than one person, you use <em>ihr</em></strong>. This is also a "familiar" form, so
        use it in the same settings as <em>du</em>.
    </p>
    <p>The German <em>ihr</em> you learned earlier is the <strong>informal plural</strong> of "you," like in</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hans und Karl, habt ihr Zeit? (Hans and Karl, do you have time?)</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">36<em>Sie</em> (formal you)</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        If you are <strong>not familiar</strong> with someone or still wish to stay <strong>
        formal and express
        respect
    </strong>, you use <em>Sie</em> (so-called "siezen"). For example, you would always address your
        professor like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Haben <em>Sie</em> jetzt Zeit, Herr Schmidt? (Do you have time now, Mr. Schmidt?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <em>Sie</em> is also used for multiple people. But you can't translate it well with "you all" or "you guys",
        because that would sound too informal.
    </p>
    <p>Here are the three forms of "you", and "they" for comparison:</p>
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>English person</th>
            <th>ending</th>
            <th>German example</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>you (singular informal)</td>
            <td>-st</td>
            <td>du trink<strong><em>st</em></strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>you (plural informal)</td>
            <td>-t</td>
            <td>ihr trink<strong><em>t</em></strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>you (formal)</td>
            <td>-en</td>
            <td>Sie trink<strong><em>en</em></strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>they</td>

            <td>sie trink<strong><em>en</em></strong></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        When spoken, <strong>"they" and formal "you" are identical</strong>. So, in a way, Germans formally address
        people like "How are they today?"
    </p>
</div>
<h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">37 How do you know if <em>sie</em> means "she", "they", or "you"?</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        You can distinguish the formal <em>Sie</em> from the plural <em>sie</em> (they) because the <strong>
        formal <em>Sie</em>
        will always be capitalized
    </strong>. However, it will remain ambiguous at the beginning of written sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
        For instance, <em>Sie sind schön.</em> can either refer to a beautiful individual or a group of beautiful people.
        The verbs for <em>sie</em> (they) and <em>Sie</em> (you) are conjugated the same. On Duolingo, either should be
        accepted unless the context suggests otherwise. In real life, there's always context. Don't worry about
        misunderstandings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, the <strong>verb for <em>sie</em> (she) is different</strong>. <em>Sie ist schön.</em> only
        translates to "She is beautiful." There's no ambiguity.
    </p>
</div>
<h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">38 Other formal "you"s</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        There are more ways to address people formally in German, but they are not in common use and/or outdated, so we
        don't support them in this course. You might encounter them in Middle Ages reenactments or so :)

    <p>The <em>second person plural</em> was also used, and is still used locally:</p>

    <div>
        <p>
            The word <em>Sehenswürdigkeit</em> (<em>sight</em> as in <em>sightseeing</em>) is made up of several
            meaningful parts: <em>sehen</em> + <em>s</em> + <em>würdig</em> + <em>keit</em>.
        </p>
        <p>Let's look at each part and its meaning.</p>
        <table class="table">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Part</th>
                <th>Meaning</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>sehen</td>
                <td>to see</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-s-</td>
                <td>connecting element</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>würdig</td>
                <td>to be worthy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-keit</td>
                <td>noun suffix</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Literally <em>Sehenswürdigkeit</em> means <em>something which is worthy to see</em>.</p>
        <p>The connecting element <em>-s-</em> is used to link words together. </p>
        <p>The ending <em>-keit</em> turns an adjective into a noun.</p>
        <p>
            Often the ending of a compound noun is a good indicator for the gender of the noun. For example, if a noun
            ends in <em>-keit</em>, it will always be feminine (die).

    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">43 <em>Urlaub</em> vs. <em>Ferien</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            Just like in English there's "holidays" and "vacation", in German there are <em>Ferien</em> and
            <em>Urlaub</em>. They can be used interchangeably to some extent.
        </p>
        <p><em>Ferien</em> only exists as a plural noun:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Die Ferien sind im Sommer. (The holidays are in summer.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Urlaub</em> only exists as a singular noun:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wann ist der Urlaub? (When is the vacation?)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">44 <em>Visum</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            In English, you need "a visa". In German, the singular is <em>das Visum</em>, <em>Visa</em> is the plural (as
            it is in Latin, the source language of this word).
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">45<em>Weg</em> vs. <em>weg</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p><em>Der Weg</em> (with a long <em>-e-</em>) roughly means "the path".</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Der Weg ist lang. (The path is long.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The word <em>weg</em> (with a short, open <em>-e-</em>) roughly means "away". Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Geh <em>weg</em>! (Go away!)</li>
            <li>Ich bin <em>weg</em>! (I'm gone!)</li>
        </ul>

    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">46 German numbers</h4>
    <div>
        <p>You learned earlier that the numbers from 1-19 are very similar to those in English.</p>
        <p>
            This mostly continues in German, with one important quirk. Did you ever notice that the digits in numbers
            13-19 are kind of "switched" in English? German continues that through to 99.
        </p>
        <p>So <strong>84 would be <em>vier|und|acht|zig</em></strong> (literally, four and eighty).</p>
        <p>This might take some getting used to, but at least it's consistent ;)</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">47 Hundert</h4>
    <div>
        <p>For "100", people would usually just say <em>hundert</em>, not <em>einhundert</em> (as in English).</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white"> 48 Huge numbers</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            There used to be two different systems for huge numbers, called "short scale" and "long scale".
            Unfortunately, German and American English ended up with different ones. British English used to use the
            long scale, but switched to short scale.

        <p>While that might look a bit chaotic, there is not so much going on:</p>
        <p>
            1) <strong>Masculine</strong>: <strong>Either the article, or the adjective</strong> must have the
            <em>-r</em> ending. The same goes for <strong>neuter and <em>-s</em></strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>De<strong>r</strong> klein<strong>e</strong></em> Hund spielt.</li>
            <li><em>Ein klein<strong>er</strong> Hund</em> spielt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            2) <strong>Feminine and Plural end in <em>-e</em></strong>. If you <strong>add an article</strong>, you also
            have to <strong>add an <em>-n</em></strong>.
        </p>

        <h5>Accusative</h5>
        <p>
            Do you remember that quite often, the accusative looks like the nominative? Specifically, only the articles
            for masculine nouns change.
        </p>
        <p>
            The same goes for the adjectives. The accusative endings are the same as for Nominative; the only exception
            is for masculine nouns. The changes are marked in bold in the table below.

    <h3 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white"> 51 Imperative</h3>
    <div>
        <p>The imperative mood is used to express commands, just like in English.</p>
        <p>There are three different forms, according to the three types of "you" in German.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">52 <em>Du</em> imperative</h4>
    <div>
        <p>The imperative for <em>du</em> is very similar to English:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Du gehst</em> nach Hause. (You go home.)</li>
            <li><em>Geh</em> nach Hause! (Go home!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For most verbs, to come up with the correct verb form, just lose the <em>-st</em> ending:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Du arbeite<strong>st</strong> nachts. (You work at night)</li>
            <li>
                <p>Arbeite nachts! (Work at night!)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Du nimm<strong>st</strong> das Taxi. (You take the taxi.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>Nimm das Taxi! (Take the taxi!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You might have noticed that some common verbs have an extra umlaut in the 2nd/3rd person singular:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>f<strong>a</strong>hren, du f<strong>ä</strong>hrst</li>
            <li>schl<strong>a</strong>fen, du schl<strong>ä</strong>fst</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the imperative, <strong>these do not have an umlaut</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Du f<strong>ä</strong>hrst mit dem Taxi.</li>
            <li>F<strong>a</strong>hr mit dem Taxi!</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">53 <em>Ihr</em> imperative</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            The second one is used to address more than one person informally. It uses the same conjugation as the
            regular <em>ihr</em> form of the present tense. This form of the imperative does not include a personal
            pronoun.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Ihr fahrt</em> nach Paris. (You go to Paris.)</li>
            <li><em>Fahrt</em> nach Paris! (Go to Paris!)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">54 <em>Sie</em> imperative</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            The third one is used to address one or more people formally. It uses the same conjugation as the regular
            <em>Sie</em> form of the present tense. The formal imperative is the only form to include the personal
            pronoun (<em>Sie</em>). Note that the word order is reversed. The verb always precedes the pronoun. It
            essentially looks like a question.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Sie lernen</em> Deutsch. (You learn German.)</li>
            <li><em>Lernen Sie</em> Deutsch! (Learn German!)</li>
            <li>Lernen Sie Deutsch<strong>?</strong> (Do you learn German?)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">55 Imperative for <em>sein</em></h4>
    <div>
        <p>The verb <em>sein</em> (to be) is highly irregular. It even has its own imperative version:</p>
        <table class="table">

            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The following sentences all mean "Please be quiet!":</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Sei</em> bitte ruhig! (one friend)</li>
            <li><em>Seid</em> bitte ruhig! (several friends)</li>
            <li><em>Seien Sie</em> bitte ruhig! (some person in the cinema)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">56 <em>Nehmen, du nimmst</em>??</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            As mentioned before, a small number of common verbs changes the vowel in the second + third person
            singular.
        </p>
        <p>The change will normally be from <em>a</em> to <em>ä</em> or from <em>e</em> to <em>i(e)</em>.</p>

    <div>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Ein Student</em> is a university student</strong> and a <em>Schüler</em> is a pupil/student at a
            primary, secondary or high school. Students attending other types of schools such as language or dancing
            schools may also be called <em>Schüler</em>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">58 Dropping articles</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            When talking about your or someone else's profession in sentences such as <em>I'm a teacher</em> or <em>
            She's
            a judge
        </em>, German speakers <strong>usually drop the indefinite article</strong> <em>(ein/eine)</em>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ich bin Lehrer. (I am <strong>a</strong> teacher.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It sounds more natural to say <em>Ich bin Lehrer</em> and <em>Sie ist Richterin</em> than <em>
            Ich bin ein
            Lehrer
        </em> and <em>Sie ist eine Richterin</em>. This rule also applies to students.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you <strong>add an adjective</strong>, you <strong>can't drop the article</strong>. <em>
            Er ist ein
            schlechter Arzt
        </em> (He's a bad doctor) is correct, but <em>Er ist schlechter Arzt</em> is not.
        </p>
        <p>Also note that <strong>you can't drop the definite article</strong> <em>(der/die/das)</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white" >59 Male and female variants</h4>
    <div>
        <p>The grammatical gender usually matches the biological sex of the person you're referring to.</p>
        <p>
            So the word that refers to a male baker is grammatically masculine, and the word that refers to a female
            baker is grammatically feminine.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the vast majority of cases, <strong>
            the female variant is formed by simply adding the suffix <em>-in</em>
            to the male variant
        </strong>, e.g. <em>der Bäcker</em> becomes <em>die Bäckerin</em> and <em>
            der
            Schüler
        </em> (the pupil) becomes <em>die Schülerin</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The plural</strong> of the female variant <strong>
            is formed by adding the ending <em>-innen</em>
        </strong> to the singular of the male variant, e.g. <em>die Bäcker<strong>innen</strong></em> and <em>
            die
            Schüler<strong>innen</strong>
        </em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind that, in some cases, the plural comes with an umlauted stem vowel. This applies to the female
            variant as well.

    <div>
        <p>Accusative prepositions <strong>always</strong> trigger the accusative case.</p>
        <p>Here are the most common ones: <strong>durch, für, gegen, ohne, um</strong></p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">63 Dative prepositions</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Dative prepositions <strong>always</strong> trigger the dative case.</p>
        <p>Here are the most common ones: <strong>aus, außer, bei, gegenüber, mit, nach, seit, von, zu</strong></p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">64 Two-way prepositions</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            <strong>Two-way prepositions</strong> take the <strong>dative case or the accusative case</strong>, depending
            on the context.
        </p>
        <p>This is an unusual, but central part of German grammar.</p>
        <p>If there's <strong>movement from one place to another</strong>, use the <strong>accusative</strong> case.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Die Katze geht <em>in die Küche</em>. (The cat walks into the kitchen.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If there's <strong>no movement</strong>, or if there's <strong>movement within a certain place</strong>, use
            the <strong>dative</strong> case.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Die Katze schläft <em>in der Küche</em>. (The cat sleeps in the kitchen.)</li>
            <li>Die Katze geht <em>in der Küche</em>. (The cat walks within the kitchen.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These prepositions can switch case: <strong>an, auf, hinter, in, neben, über, unter, vor, zwischen</strong>

    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">65 When <em>not</em> to think about location change</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Two-way prepositions are very common in everyday speech, so it's a good idea to practice them to fluency.</p>
        <p>However, don't forget that <strong>for some prepositions, you don't have to decide</strong>:</p>
        <p>
            <em>Durch</em> and <em>um</em> will always be accusative, although they might signify an activity without
            location change:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Das Kind rennt <em>durch den</em> Wald. (The child is running through the forest.)</li>
            <li>Die Stühle stehen <em>um den</em> Tisch. (The chairs are standing around the table.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>Aus</em>, <em>von</em>, <em>zu</em> will always be dative, although they might signify a location change.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Er kommt <em>aus der</em> Küche (He comes out of the kitchen.)</li>
            <li>Ich fahre <em>zur</em> Arbeit. (I go to work.)</li>
            <li>Ich komme <em>von der</em> Arbeit. (I come from work.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">66 Other uses for two-way prepositions</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            Some verbs use one of these prepositions in a way that is <em>not about location</em>. This is part of
            language change, where things get repurposed all the time.
        </p>
        <p><em>Über</em> will always trigger the accusative case:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sie diskutieren <em>über den</em> Krieg. (They discuss the war.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When used with these verbs, <em>vor</em> will always trigger the Dative:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Er warnt <em>vor dem</em> Hund. (He warns about the dog.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>An</em>, <em>in</em> and <em>auf</em> are more complicated: in some verbs, they trigger the accusative,
            in others the dative. You'll just have to memorize these.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Er <em>denkt</em> <em>an seinen</em> Bruder. (He thinks of his brother.)</li>
            <li>
                <p>Er <em>arbeitet</em> <em>an einem</em> Film (He's working on a film.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ich <em>warte</em> <em>auf den</em> Bus. (I'm waiting for the bus.)</p>
            </li>

    <h4 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">68 Preposition at the end of a sentence??</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            An important part of German grammar is that some verbs can split off their prefix. This often ends up at the
            end of a sentence. Some of these prefixes look exactly like a preposition.
        </p>
        <p>
            So when you see a "preposition" at the end of a sentence, try to combine it with the verb. You might just
            have learned a new word :)
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Sie <em>macht</em> die Lampe <em>an</em>. (<em>anmachen</em> means "turn on" here)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ich <em>denke nach</em>. (<em>nachdenken</em> means "to think")</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Pass</em> auf dich <em>auf</em>! (<em>aufpassen</em> means "to take care")</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Wann <em>fährt</em> der Zug <em>ab</em>? (<em>abfahren</em> means "to depart")</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Nimm</em> deinen Hut <em>ab</em>! (<em>abnehmen</em> means "to take off" in this context)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, the way Duolingo is built does not allow to selectively teach German sentence structure. We
            hope this will change soon :)

    <h3 class="p-2 mt-5 mb-2 bg-info text-white">69 <em>Zu Hause</em> vs. <em>nach Hause</em></h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            <em>Zu Hause</em> means <em>at home</em>, and <em>nach Hause</em> means <em>home</em> (<em>homewards</em>,
            not <em>at home</em>). The <em>-e</em> at the end of <em>zu Hause</em> and <em>nach Hause</em> is an archaic
            dative ending, which is no longer used in modern German, but survives in certain fixed expressions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Ich bin <em>zu Hause</em>. (I am <em>at home</em>.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ich gehe <em>nach Hause</em>. (I am walking <em>home</em>.)</p>

    <div>
        <p><em>Plastik</em> is one of the few words that changes meaning, depending on which gender it is.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>das Plastik (artificial material, normally from petroleum)</li>

    <div>
        <p>In English, "wood" can refer to a material, and to a forest.</p>
        <p>
            In German, <em>Holz</em> only refers to the material. <em>Der Wald</em> is "the forest". We also have a word
            <em>der Forst</em>, but it only refers to a maintained forest (something like a garden for trees), where the
            trees are grown for commercial purposes.

        <p>Ordinal numbers behave like adjectives, so their endings will change accordingly:</p>
